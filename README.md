## Introduction  
  
...
  
  
After these few months learning Python and Django with Openclassrooms, it is time to put all my learnings into an actual working Django app.  
  
When time came to choose a side-project, I dreamed many unfeasable ideas for the 'App' but definitevely not worth adding burden to poor Earth.  
  
We're, like many others a spread over family, across regions, across countries and each travelling back and forth.   
  
So grow the idea of sharing together in a secure way where we are what we do even sometimes letting he, her ,they join in.  
  
Privacy is sensible so we couldn't 'just' use a shared agenda hosted by one of big [`FAANG`/`NATU`/`BHATX`/`YVMOR`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) ; Nothing against for other services but not for where-we-are-when and what-we-do.  

The project is intented to be open source shared with anyone (check the `AGPLv3`, wanted a copyleft one including hosted services). Will see how far we will go in that direction.  



So first step is to gather ideas on possible app usage, former open source projects and investigate coding tools and solutions.

Next wwould be to define a scope for the solution, write down and share use cases. 

**Having fun, Devs!**

## Security and privacy  
    
We do take your privacy and your data safety very seriously. 
We intend to set several security measures to ensure nothing bad may happen to your data.  
  
All technical operations are logged and help us to prevent and identify any mis-behavior or attacks
Finally the code itself is secured by reducing the exposure of secrets to public repositories,   
  
MFA, encrypt
